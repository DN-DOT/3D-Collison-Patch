# 3D-Collison-Patch
 3D bounding box collision patch created for the augmented reality software sparkAR. 
 Connect two 3D objects to detect collison - boolean output. 
Can read my blog on the path and how it was used with hand tracking to create my Singing Bowl filter - https://www.dncherry.com/post/3d-collision-patch-handtracking-with-sparkar
