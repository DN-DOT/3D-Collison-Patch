# 3D-Collison-Patch
 3D bounding box collision patch created for the augmented reality software sparkAR. 
 Connect two 3D objects to detect collison. Boolean output. 
Can read my blog on the path and how it was used with hand tracking to create my Singing Bowl filter - https://www.dncherry.com/post/3d-collision-patch-handtracking-with-sparkar
